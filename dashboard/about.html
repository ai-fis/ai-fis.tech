    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      At AI-FIS, we believe financial systems should be as responsive, transparent, and human-centered as the communities they serve.
      Our dashboard turns raw data into music — a universal language of accountability.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Born from necessity, AI-FIS was conceived by Phillip Rucacu Kariuki — a builder, thinker, and survivor of systems that silenced truth.
      AI-FIS listens. It speaks when others refuse. And it is built not for profits, but for people.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      A world where data doesn’t drown — it sings.
      Where every financial system is audible, and every citizen has the power to listen.
