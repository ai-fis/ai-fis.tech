    <h1>Case Studies</h1>
    <p>AI-FIS Technologies is built from real-world experience and responds to real-world needs. Below are key deployments and initiatives that demonstrate the platform’s power to expose hidden signals and restore public accountability.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Kenya – Spotlight on Integrity</h2>
    <p>Born from the need to track and sonify systemic abuse in public finance and procurement fraud, AI-FIS was first conceived as a response to financial irregularities and asset concealment in Kenya. Our dashboard now provides sonic insight into ghost workers, unverified suppliers, and real-time money flow.</p>
    <p>By connecting AI pattern recognition with human-audible feedback, we empower investigators, journalists, and civil society with an intuitive way to “hear” fiscal corruption. In real-time, fraud leaves a trace. AI-FIS ensures it leaves a sound.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>East Africa Regional Deployment</h2>
    <p>AI-FIS is being developed as a multi-nodal, post-quantum secure platform for the African continent. With integration points identified in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, we aim to deliver the first harmonized public integrity sound system across national boundaries.</p>
    <p>Each node sonifies the local data context: procurement anomalies, budget drift, debt exposure. The shared intelligence becomes a harmonic fingerprint of fiscal trust.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Beyond Borders</h2>
    <p>As AI-FIS evolves, we're engaging diaspora technologists and governance innovators from across the globe. Our tools will soon enable international monitoring, post-election financial surveillance, and disaster-relief budget tracking.</p>
    <p>Whether at a ministry desk in Nairobi, a courtroom in Kampala, or a press room in Washington, AI-FIS can speak to you. All you have to do is listen.</p>
