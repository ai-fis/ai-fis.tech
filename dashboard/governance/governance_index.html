  <h1>Governance & Ethics</h1>
  <p>AI-FIS is built on the principle that artificial intelligence must serve public good, not private gain. Our governance framework includes reflective AI oversight, legal-bound system design, and ethical sonification protocols.</p>
  <p>Our modules (REFAIL, INFAIL) are designed not only to detect patterns, but to question them. We believe systems must not only act â€” they must reflect, explain, and justify their actions to the communities they affect.</p>
